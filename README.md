this AI assistant is developed during my internship at MDweb i am asked to make the chatbot using the openAI ai assistants api so i am exploring the possibility of this technology by creating this AI news summerizer to try out the custon functions calling feature.

To start the app you can start a new virtual enviromment through your terminal by the following command and then activate it :
python -m venv venvname / ./venv/Scripts/activate

The following step is to install all the dependecies and that's easy since we have a requirements.txt so all you have to do is to run the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Your App is now ready to run :
streamlit main.py and you will be able to find it in http://localhost:8501 or https://127.0.0.1:8501
